Feature: Editing tickets
 Affinch√® si possano aggiornare i dati relativi ad un ticket
 Come un utente autenticato, che padrone del ticket
 Voglio poterlo fare tramite una comoda form 
 Attivabile in maniera semplice dalla pagina relativa al ticket
 
Background: 
  
  Given there are the following users: 
   | email                  | password |
   | user@ticketee.com      | password |
  
  And I am signed in as "user@ticketee.com" 
  
  And There is a project called "TextMate 2"
  And "user@ticketee.com" has created a ticket for this project:
   | title         | description                 |	
   |Make it shiny! |Gradients! Starbursts! Oh my!|
 
  Given I am on the homepage
  When I follow "TextMate 2"
  And I follow "Make it shiny!"
  And I follow "Edit Ticket"

Scenario: Updating a ticket

 When I fill in "Ticket title" with "Make it really shiny!!"
 And I press "Update Ticket"
 Then I should see "Ticket has been updated."
 And I should see "Make it really shiny!!" within "#ticket_title_field h2"     
 But I should not see "Make it shiny!"
