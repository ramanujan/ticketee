Feature: Editing users
 
 Affinch√® si possano cambiare i dettagli di un utente 
 Come amministratore del sistema
 Voglio essere in grado di farlo attraverso una comoda interfaccia

  | email              | password | admin |
  | admin@ticketee.com | password | true  |
  | user@ticketee.com  | password | false |
  
  And I am signed in as "admin@ticketee.com"
  And I am on the homepage
  When I follow "Admin"
