Feature: Creating users
 Affinch√® si possano aggiungere nuovi utenti all'applicazione
 Come utente amministratore 
 Voglio essere in grado di farlo attraverso una comoda interfaccia.

Background:
 Given there are the following users:
  | email              | password | admin |
  | admin@ticketee.com | password | true  |
 
 And I am signed in as "admin@ticketee.com" 
 Given I am on the homepage
 When I follow "Admin"
 And I follow "Users"
 And I follow "New User"

Scenario: Creating a new user
 And I fill in "Email" with "newbie@ticketee.com"
 And I fill in "Password" with "password"
 And I fill in "Password confirmation" with "password"
 And I press "Create User"
 Then I should see "User has been created."

Scenario: Leaving email blank results in an error
 When I fill in "Email" with ""
 And I fill in "Password" with "password"
 And I press "Create User"
 Then I should see "User has not been created."
 And I should see "Email can't be blank"
  
Scenario: Creating an admin user 
   And I fill in "Email" with "newadmin@ticketee.com"
   And I fill in "Password" with "password"
   And I fill in "Password confirmation" with "password"
   And I check "Is an admin?" 
   And I press "Create User"
   Then I should see "User has been created."
